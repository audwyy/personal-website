            <h1>the boring stuff...</h1>
            <p> I'm a UNSW third year student studying Finance and Computer Science. Fun fact: from the age of 5, I learned to play the piano and I continued to perform and recieved my AMus AMEB Diploma during COVID.
            <br><br> In High School, I joined my school's Future Problem Team because my friend needed an extra memeber. We spent many 7am mornings working on case studies and producing solutions. I didn't expect to win a National title for this competition, but my team won the Australian Middle Division. We were all shocked. It started as a 
                fun group activity where we could all meet and talk before class, but it turned into something even better. We travelled to Brisbane with 2 other teams and competed against teams all over Australia. Consequently, we were invited to go to the International Competition in 
                the University of Massachusetts. It was the first time I've ever been to the USA and I was so grateful for that opportunity. We met teams from all over the world and we placed second for the Presentation of Action Plan.

                        <p> I didn't imagine my uni experience to exceed my expectations. I really went out of my comfort zone and met a bunch of 
                            people. I think joining EngSoc in 2023 was one of the best things I could've done for myself. I am super glad I got accepted into the 
                            Social's Portfolio where we organised the annual EngSoc events for engineering students.

                <p>In the same year, I also got accepted into the Computer Science and Engineering Society Events Portfolio! I met a lot of people studying Computer Science with me and was able to make unforgettable friendships and memories with these people.
                    We organised the CSESoc Weekly BBQ's, flagship events such as First Year Camp, CSESoc Ball and other collaboration events with other societies.

                <p>I also did my first hackathon! I did it with my fellow EngSoc subcom members and it was surprisingly very fun as it was the first time we had done a university competition. We spent 24 hours working on our solution and creating our UI for our app... Carbon Feat!
                The prompt was to address the environmental effects humans have on our planet. We had to design an app/website to provide a solution to this issue. We designed an app that tracks a user's carbon footprint. We placed as a runner up in the no-code stream! </p>

                    Then, in 2024 I became a director for EngSoc Social's portfolio with my 2 co-directors! I could've never expected what 2024 had to offer...

            <p> At the beginning of the year, we all weren't that close. Then throughout the year, we all started to get to know each other's true personalities and that's when things changed...
            <br>People that I never expected to get close to actually slowly became my closest friends.

            <p>I also did one of my favourite classes that year, we had to prepare a presentation as advisors to determine a "buy" or "sell" recommendation for investors into SalesForce. We chose this company because of their recent innovation in AI and all of our team members were very intrigued by the recent advances in AI and how this shapes the business industry. I really enjoyed this assignment as it really allowed me to use my financial knowledge and FactSet which gave us really in-depth financial information on almost any company we could think of!
            We could see and compare the financial data from various years, geographical news, import/export information of products used by companies, acquisitions over other companies etc.  It was really fun to finally put classroom knowledge to something that can be used in "real-life".
