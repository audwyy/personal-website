        <h2>audrey's world</h2>
        <p>I made this website as my application for DevSoc training program. Theme was "Around the World", so naturally the first thing that popped into my head was a globe.
            <br><br>
            I learned to use a 3D modelling platform called Spline. It was just like learning how to use Photoshop... there were so many functions and dealing with 3D planes on a 
            computer screen was very hard. However, it was actually really fun and made me feel accomplished when I finished designing my globe. 
            <br><br>
            As you hover over the countries I've visited, more information will pop up!
