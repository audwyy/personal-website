                    <h2>Strong Communication and Technical Skills</h2>
                    <p class="box-content">I have extensive experience in client-facing roles, including tutoring and working at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. During my time at CBA, I participated in numerous client relationship-building programs and up-skilling initiatives, which helped me hone my communication skills and strengthen customer retention. Having gained experience in a well-established company where achieving high levels of customer satisfaction is both prioritised and closely monitored, I have developed the ability to perform effectively under pressure. This experience has refined my ability to engage with clients effectively, navigate complex situations, and maintain a high standard of service.

                        <br>
                        Through my double degree in Computer Science and Finance, I have developed a unique blend of technical programming expertise and financial knowledge. My adaptability and quick learning ability allow me to efficiently master new systems.

                    <h2>Analyse Complex Financial Data</h2>
                    <p class="box-content">From a young age I've been intrigued by the fluidity of the financial market and staying updated with changes in the market. I pursued this interest academically, graduating from high school before enrolling at UNSW, Australia's leading business school, where I earned multiple distinctions in financial management and business decision-making courses. With the skills I've learnt and applied within the classroom, my consistent determination to remain curious has only led me to gain more valuable insight into analysing market structures and changes.</p>

                    <h2>Attention to Detail</h2>
                    <p class="box-content">My strong attention to detail has been an asset throughout my academic and professional journey. Through high school and university, my quantitative skills have allowed me to detect anomalies in financial behaviour and develop insights into underlying market behaviour. This attention to detail is essential in the context of investment banking, where accuracy and precision are critical. Through my experience working within a large financial institution, I have learned the importance of asking the right questions and ensuring every element of financial analysis is thoroughly examined.</p>
